##Design Evaluation
#What features led us to build off of Cyril’s and Luke’s code
  *Hybrid but used Cyril’s code as the basis and pulled in features as needed
  *Solid class structure
  *Combined, we had all of the requirements from part 1. The code we had was a good starting point for this assignment.
#Our decisions achieved our expectations because…
  *Class design was scalable and coherent, which made it easy to manipulate and adapt it to the new version/new rules
  *Could focus on new features without having to rework much of the existing code
